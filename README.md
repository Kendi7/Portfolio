Global Styles

Header and Profile

The header section contains a profile image and personal information. Flexbox is used to align the elements side by side, giving a neat and professional look.

Main Content Area and Sidebar

Uses flexbox for layout, with the sidebar and main content displayed next to each other. The sidebar features navigation links, while the main content area holds sections like About Me, Skills, Education, Projects, and Contact.

Sections with Background Images

Different sections (e.g., About, Education) feature background images to enhance the design. Each section is styled with text readability in mind.

Responsive Design

The site adjusts its layout for smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices) using media queries. It ensures that the content looks great on all screen sizes by stacking elements and resizing sections.

HTML Structure
The HTML code provides the structure of the website. It is organized into several sections to display the content logically and cleanly. The HTML includes:

Header Section

Main Content:

Consists of sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Education," "Projects," and "Contact," each with its own background image and styled content.

Each section of the HTML is styled using the CSS, with specific classes and IDs to target the relevant elements.
