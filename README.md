Global Styles
This section defines the basic styles for the entire website. It sets the font, background color, and text color for the body. Additionally, it removes any default margin and padding and applies a consistent box-sizing rule.

Header Section
The header section is styled with a green background and white text. It uses flexbox to align the profile image and text (name, role) side by side, with a gap between them. The profile image is circular, with a set width and height.

Profile Section
The profile section contains a profile image and text information about the user. The layout is arranged using flexbox, placing the image and text side by side. The image is styled to appear circular, with a fixed width and height.

Container Layout
This section manages the layout of the main content area and the sidebar. The main content takes up the remaining space, and the sidebar has a dark background and white text. The container is styled using flexbox to position the sidebar and main content side by side.

Section Styles with Background Images
Different sections of the website, such as "About Me," "Education," and "Skills," have unique background images. These sections are styled to ensure the text is readable by applying background blending and adjusting padding, margins, and borders for each section.

Form Styles
Forms on the website are styled with a column layout using flexbox. Input fields and text areas are given padding and a border, and they occupy a set percentage of the available width. The submit button is styled with a dark background and changes color on hover.

Footer Section
The footer is styled with a dark background and white text. The content is centered, and there is padding around the text. Links in the footer are white and change color when hovered over.

Responsiveness for Mobile Devices
The CSS includes a media query to ensure the website is responsive on smaller devices (screen width of 768px or less). The layout adjusts so that the container elements stack vertically, and the sidebar takes up 100% of the available width on smaller screens.
